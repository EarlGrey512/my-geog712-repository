# Folder Structure
The folders have been created for organization of my research. 

Data is where I will store my cleaned data and graphs that I generate. It will also contain documents where I describe and explain each graph. The values in this folder will contain any patterns I notice from the data, meaning not all the patterns noticed in the data will be used in the paper if it does not relate to my research question.

Figures will contain images that I can implement into my research.

Code will contain the codes from software that I have used and will be available for reproducability and repeatability purposes.
